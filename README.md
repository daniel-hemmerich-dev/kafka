# Apache Kafka Tutorial

## History (who, when, why)
Apache Kafka was created at LinkedIn and released on January 2011. It is written in Scala and Java.

## What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is publish-subscribe based fault tolerant messaging system. It is fast, scalable and distributed by design.
Kafka is a unified platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka supports low latency message delivery and gives guarantee for fault tolerance in the presence of machine failures.

## Use Cases
### Metrics
Kafka is often used for operational monitoring data. This involves aggregating statistics from distributed applications to produce centralized feeds of operational data.
### Log Aggregation 
Kafka can be used across an organization to collect logs from multiple services and make them available in a standard format to multiple con-sumers.
### Stream Processing
Popular frameworks such as Storm and Spark Streaming read data from a topic, processes it, and write processed data to a new topic where it becomes available for users and applications. Kafkaâ€™s strong durability is also very useful in the context of stream processing.
